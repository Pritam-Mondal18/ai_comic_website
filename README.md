# ComicCrafter AI - Comic Style Story Generator

## Overview
<p>ComicCrafter AI is a generative AI-based comic generator that runs locally on edge devices. It creates comic-style stories based on user input prompts, dividing the story into four parts: introduction, storyline, climax, and moral of the story.</p><br/>

## Problem Description

<p>The objective of ComicCrafter AI is to develop an application capable of generating a comic book-style short story based on a user-provided prompt. The application should generate a story split into four parts: introduction, storyline, climax, and moral. The project will be executed in four distinct phases:</p>

## Phase 1: LLM Story Generation

<ul>
  <li>Develop a module that generates a coherent story using LLMs based on the user’s prompt.</li>
  <li>he story is divided into four parts: introduction, storyline, climax, and moral.</li>
</ul>

## Phase 2: Image Generation

<ul>
  <li>Develop a module that generates images corresponding to each story part using AI-based image generation tools like Stable Diffusion.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the images are coherent with the story.</li>
</ul>

## Phase 3: Merging Story and Images

<ul>
  <li>Create a system to merge the generated text and images into a cohesive comic book format.</li>
  <li>Ensure proper alignment and formatting of the text and images.</li>
</ul>

## Phase 4: App Integration

<ul>
  <li>Integrate the story generation, image generation, and merging modules into a single web application.</li>
  <li>Optimize the app for efficient performance on edge devices.</li>
</ul>

## Outcomes Expected

<ul>
  <li>Functional Application: A fully functional app that generates comic book-style stories based on user prompts.</li>
  <li>User Engagement: An engaging and interactive UI that allows users to input prompts and view generated comics.</li>
  <li>Edge Deployment: A successful deployment of the app on edge devices, ensuring efficient performance and resource optimization.
</li>
</ul>

## Challenges Involved

<ul>
  <li>Story Coherence: Ensuring that the LLM generates a coherent, engaging story based on a user’s prompt.</li>
  <li>Image Relevance: Generating images that align with and represent the story in a comic book style.</li>
  <li>Integration: Seamlessly integrating text and images into a cohesive comic book format.</li>
  <li>Edge Deployment: Optimizing the application to run efficiently on edge devices with limited computational resources.</li>
</ul>

## Tools & Resources to be Used

<ul>
  <li>LLMs: Use open-weight models like Llama, Deepseek, or Mistral. Evaluate the best model for generating stories based on the requirements.</li>
  <li>Image Generation Tools: Leverage open-weight models like Stable Diffusion for generating images, deployable via platforms like Comfy UI or Intel AI Playground.</li>
  <li>Programming Languages: Python for developing the story generation, image generation, and integration modules.</li>
  <li>Edge Devices: Utilize Intel-based edge devices for deploying and running the application locally.</li>
  <li>App Development Frameworks: Use Streamlit or similar Python-based frameworks to integrate all modules into a user-friendly web interface.</li>
</ul>
